What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

GIT sets up the necessary metadata to track files that are under its control in the directory and sets the initial (empty) change tracking history.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  It implements the concept of files that will be part of the next commit...
What value do you think it offers? flexibility in choosing new files to commit, plus (probably) the tracking of which files already part of the repository are changed since the last commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

By only doing "git add" for files which have been modified for that change; unrelated changes can be added/ committed after the commit for the 1st logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
